Scientific content
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Abstracts, if included, should briefly summarize what the talk will be about.  An abstract should not be an entire manuscript, but it may include a link to a manuscript.  Preprints belong elsewhere, such as the <a href="https://arxiv.org">arXiv</a> or <a href="https://vixra.org">viXra</a>.</li>
  <li>Talks based on joint research should mention all co-authors in the abstract.</li>
  <li>Content added by users should be accurate, to the best of knowledge of the user.</li>
  <li>Comments unrelated to the scientific content are not allowed anywhere on this site.  For example, venting of grievances is inappropriate here.</li>
