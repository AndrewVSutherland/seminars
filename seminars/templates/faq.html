  <li> What should I do if my seminar doesn't meet weekly?
    <br>
    <p> If it meets every other week on the same day, you can set the Frequency to 14 in the Edit seminar page.  If it meets on different days of the week, you won't be able to use the Scheduler page, but you can still add talks one by one.</p>
