1. fix default date range


Admin (Edgar)
=====

1. Add ability to request endorsement, then update public_users.html with a link.

1. Add ability to deal with spam: admins should be able to easily hide a page, which should shut down the editing ability of the user who changed it last

1. Stop connecting to the lmfdb database

1. add captcha to reset password and register

1. Use gmail's api or some other api

1. Forward back to page once you log in: https://github.com/LMFDB/lmfdb/blob/master/lmfdb/users/main.py#L251

1. Give users ability to toggle between 24 hour time and am/pm.


Content creation
================

1. **Allow multiple topics (use multi select from [select-pure](https://www.npmjs.com/package/select-pure))**

1. **Makes sure that content creators can cancel or delete talks and seminars if they want.**

1. **Improve text at manage when not endorsed (Raymond)**

1. **In edit seminar, move toom right under end time (Bjorn)**

1. **For conference, enter dates rather than frequency**

1. **Test creating seminar without being endorsed**

1. **Cancel -> Cancel changes**

1. **Add additional talk into main form, add new fields, maybe one button (if two, do the same thing), not all in one column, flash warning and keep raw data if title/email but no speaker, make details save**

1. **On manage homepage, vertical and horizontal lines in table**

1. **Uniformize on identifier (change places where called shortname)**

1. **Clarify that institution homepage means department homepage via placeholder or e.g.**

1. **Remove aliases**

1. **Placeholder in city name for institution**

1. **Add details links back in to view seminars**

1. **When viewing talk as a seminar organizer, keep seminar links**

1. **Confirmation message on successful schedule save**

1. Warning if user tries to close schedule without saving

1. When adding speakers, could give Speaker's math sci net id.

1. Consistency: add talk vs create talk (maybe create seminars, add talks)

1. Add ability to change times for all upcoming talks.

1. Allow seminars to meet on multiple days.

1. Think about the model described at https://talks.cam.ac.uk/document/Adding+a+talk (notably, the ability to include others' subscription lists into your own)

1. Think about security model of how we update the display attribute when someone gets endorsed.  Does every talk/seminar that they're an organizer for get set to display=True?  Can this be taken advantage of by adding another user as an organizer who then gets endorsed, or transferring ownership?  We don't require permission to become an organizer/transfer.  Solved if we have newly endorsed users manually have to add the content they want to be displayed.  Also: if you aren't yet endorsed, you can't add other organizers or transfer ownership.

1. Interface for creating a singleton talk?

Viewing and searching
=====================

1. **Filter option to show personal calendar**

1. **Uniformize from saved events to favorites**

1. **Add type (conference/seminar) to seminar search.**

1. **Make future the default search.**

1. **Remove count and start.**

1. **Set table min-width for all pages.**

1. **Improve styling for talk and seminar pages, add info (time and day)**

1. **Add placeholders and e.g. for seminar/talk creation**

1. **Improve institution page.**

1. **Restrict by topic not working.**

1. **Make filter checkboxes toggles.**

1. Add search on time (rather than datetime) so that users can accomodate their local schedules

1. Paginate search results.

1. Manage submenu is not idempotent

1. When searching, should have ability to flip sort order (default depends on whether past or future)

1. Figure out how to limit number of seminars shown on browse page for initial users (limit at a certain number per topic?)

1. Should conference homepage be different than a seminar's?

1. Add route that strips headers for inclusion into a seminar webpage

1. When logged in, there should be an option to see the site as if you weren't logged in

1. On the homepage, there should be a note at top explaining benefit of logging in

1. In seminar lists, have icon for online vs offline talk (could be both)

1. We now have a warning that javascript is required (displayed at top of every page).  Another model:  https://iacr.org/tinfoil.html

1. Editable tips

Knowls
======

1. **Read yaml to create static knowls**

1. Clarify online vs online only

Time zones
==========

1. **Fix Alex/Drew's time zone bug**

1. **Fix Vantage time zone**

1. Add checkbox for use institution time when creating seminar.

Localization
============

1. Add a language column for talks and seminars.

1. Django has built in internationalization system (google Zulip internationalization)

Onboarding

1. Add avenues for users to give feedback both to content creators

1. We should create a privacy policy

Calendars
=========

1. **Each seminar should have its own calendar so that seminar organizers can use it as the primary source for their own front-end.**

Email
=====

1. Tim suggest mailgun (cheapest low tier).  Can steal email code from Zulip (they also use Django).  Look at Zulip or Django documentation.  Dedicated IP address helps against spam filtering.  Or use MIT and talk to MIT help desk.

1. Figure out how to make our emails less likely to be marked spam.

1. Customizable announcement emails for seminar organizers.

Design and branding
===================

1. **Clean up css file to remove all the old stuff, think about what we want to have.**

1. Once we're ready, think about advertising strategy (Bjorn emailing number theory list; how to reach out beyond number theory, posting on Facebook, etc)

Other
=====

1. scrape some timezones https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones

1. Write tests

1. Reach out to Kiran about recruiting organizers.

1. toggle option between http and https

1. Twitter page?  Talk to someone who uses it.  Grab the username now.

1. Python-social-auth: common framework for authentication integration.  Stackexchange/mathoverflow authentication?
