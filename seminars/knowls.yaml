    Like Wikipedia, mathseminars.org uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Sentence_case">sentence case</a> 
    for seminar names and talk titles:
    only the first word and proper nouns should be capitalized.
seminar_description:

    You may associate zero or more topics to a talk, seminar, or conference.  
    Each topic corresponds to an arXiv subject class; 
    for example, <i>number theory</i> corresponds to <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/math.NT/recent">math.NT</a>.
    New talks inherit the topics of the seminar or conference to which they belong; 
    these can then be modified for a particular talk if desired.

weekday:
  title: Meeting day
  contents: |
    Set this if your seminar meets on a particular day of the week, even if your seminar does not meet every week.
    If set, this value will be used to lay out the grid used when editing your seminar's talk schedule.
    <br><br>
    For seminars that meet more than one day per week, 
    we suggest either setting the meeting day to the first day of the week your seminar meets 
    and then editing the dates on the scheduling grid,
    or not setting the meeting day and setting the frequency to 1, 
    which will give you a scheduling grid with slots for each day.
    We are currently working on features to better support seminars that meet on multiple days.
frequency:
  title: Frequency
  contents: |
    Specify the frequency of your seminar if it meets at regular intervals, every 7 or 14 days, for example.
    If your seminar does not meet on a particular day of the week you can set the frequency to 1; 
    this will yield a scheduling grid with slots for each day.
per_day:
  title: Talks per day
  contents: |
    The number of talks you expect to take place each day your seminar or conference meets.
    This is used only to determine the number of slots to create in your scheduling grid;

    Each talk, seminar, and conference has a time zone 
    that determines how dates and times associated to the event are interpreted.
    Even if your event has no particular physical location, you must set the time zone.
    <i>Warning:</i> Different time zones with 
    the same current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC</a> offset 
    may switch to daylight saving time on different dates, so choose the precise time zone, 
    not just one with the correct UTC offset.
    You may choose UTC as your time zone if you wish.
