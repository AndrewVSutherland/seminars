    Seminars are best used for series of talks that recur at regular intervals (every Tuesday and Thursday, or every other Wednesday, for example).
    Conferences are events with a fixed start and end date (usually a more or less consecutive sequence of days with some number of talks per day).
    For the most part seminars and conferences are treated identically on our site, the main difference is in how the grid for the talk schedule is layed out.
