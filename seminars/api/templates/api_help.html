<p>
  The API is currently under development, and will be subject to change without any promise of backward compatibility
  as long as the current version described here is <b>version 0</b>.  We hope to provide a stable interface soon, at which
  point we will upgrade to <b>version 1</b>.  If you have comments, feature requests or want to be informed of the switch to version 1, please visit the API <a href="https://github.com/roed314/seminars/issues/96">Github issue</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The source code for the API is available <a href="https://github.com/roed314/seminars/blob/master/seminars/api/main.py">here</a>.
  The example code blocks below are written in Python, but you can use any language able to generate and process HTTP requests.
</p>

<h2>Encoding</h2>

<p>
  Results are always encoded using json, and requests can be made using either POST or GET (except the save functions, which require POST).
</p>

<h2>Lookup</h2>

<p>
  To get public information on a specific series use {{ url_for('api.lookup_series', version=0) }}; for a talk use {{ url_for('api.lookup_talk', version=0) }}.
</p>

<h2>Searching</h2>

<p>
  To search for series satisfying certain attributes, use {{ url_for('api.search_series', version=0) }} or {{ url_for('api.search_talks', version=0) }}.  If you use the GET method, you can specify a simple query directly in the URL, giving values of attribute according to the schema table below.  If you use the POST method, you can provide more complicated queries by passing in a json query object using the query language described below.
</p>

<h2>Saving</h2>

<p>
  To save series or talks to the database, you will need to provide your program with an API key, which can be found on your <a href="{{ url_for('user.info') }}">account page</a>.  If you use <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, we highly recommend storing your API key in a separate file that you add to your <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore">gitignore</a> so that it isn't accidentally included in a public repository.
</p>

{{ code_examples["authorization"] | safe }}

<p>
  You can create a new series as follows.  Note that organizers cannot be changed through the API for existing series, but you must specify them when creating a new one.  The example includes a minimal set of attributes, but you can of course include more from the schema described below.
</p>

{{ code_examples["create_seminar_series"] | safe }}

<p>
  Most of the fields are the same for conferences, but you provide start and end dates rather than time slots.
</p>

{{ code_examples["create_conference"] | safe }}

<p>
  To edit a series, you only need to provide the fields that you want to change.  Note that it is not possible to edit organizers through the API.
</p>

{{ code_examples["edit_series"] | safe }}

<p>
  You can create and edit talks similarly.  Each talk has an integer counter which is assigned to it.  When you're created a new talk
</p>

{{ code_examples["create_talk"] | safe }}

<h3>Approval</h3>

<p>
  After updating series using the API, you must manually approve the changes by logging in and visiting your <a href="{{ url_for('create.index') }}">Manage</a> page.  This measure is intended to prevent errors in your scripts from showing up on the live site, and to guard against unauthorized updates if you lose your API key.  If this approval is a burden for your intended use case, please <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}">contact</a> us to discuss its removal.
</p>

<h2>Schema</h2>

<p>
  Details on the schema will be added here soon.  For now, see our <a href="https://github.com/roed314/seminars/blob/master/Schema.md">schema documentation on Github</a>.
</p>

<h2>Query language</h2>

<p>
  Queries are constructed from dictionaries, where each key gives a constraint for that column.  By default, values are treated as an equality constraint.  To get other conditions, the value is also taken to be a dictionary with keys special codes starting with a `$` symbol.  For example, use {"topics": {"$contains": "math_NT"}, "abstract": {"$ilike": "%p-adic%"}} to search for a talk with number theory as a topic and having an abstract that contains the string "p-adic".  Documentation for the query language will be added here.  For now, see <a href="https://github.com/LMFDB/lmfdb/blob/master/lmfdb/backend/searchtable.py#L132">the source code</a> for the special keys available.
</p>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<p>
  To specify topics you will need to know the identifier we use for them.  We provide a URL that provides the full topic graph (note that it is not a tree: mathematical physics is a subtopic of both mathematics and physics).
</p>

{{ code_examples["topics"] | safe }}

<h2>Institutions</h2>

<p>
  Similarly, you can find the identifier for institutions using the following URL (we don't provide a search interface because they don't change much).
</p>

{{ code_examples["institutions"] | safe }}
