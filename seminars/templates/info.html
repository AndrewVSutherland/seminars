{{meta_description}}  On this site, <i>seminar</i> means a talk series (which might be a conference), and a <i>talk</i> is a one-time event that occurs as part of a seminar.
</p>

<h3>Browse</h3>

<p>The front page lists upcoming talks.  You can filter them by topic to tailor them to your interests.</p>

<h3>Search</h3>

<p>You can search for seminars and talks satisfying various criteria, including specifying keywords within talk abstracts.</p>

<h3>Subscribe</h3>

<p>You can export selected seminars and talks to your own calendar (e.g., Google calendar, Outlook or iCal).  When you subscribe to a seminar, new talks will be pushed to your calendar automatically.</p>

<h3>Attend</h3>

<p>Many seminars include Zoom links allowing direct access.  Some seminar organizers make these Zoom links visible only to users logged in to a <a href="mathseminars.org">mathseminars.org</a> account.</p>

<h3>Create</h3>

<p>If you are organizing a seminar, we aim to make it easy to add your seminar to the site.  Once you create a new seminar (requires an endorsed account), you can add upcoming or historical talks.</p>

<h3>Organize</h3>

<p>Seminar organizers can add upcoming talks easily: defaults are filled in from the seminar but are editable on a per-talk basis.  Sharing a talk's edit link with speakers allows them to update their own title and abstract.  Seminar information can be exported to formats suitable for your own website or department calendar.</p>

<h3>Accounts</h3>

<p>Some features require an account.  You can regisiter for an account <a href="{{ url_for('user.register') }}">here</a>, which allows you to subscribe to seminars.  If you want to add seminars to the site, you need to be endorsed by someone on the site; once you have been endorsed you will be able to endorse others.  See if you know anyone on <a href="{{ url_for('user.public_users') }}">this list</a> of all seminar organizers and curators if you are seeking an endorsement.</p>
