    When a new talk is created, it inherits all the topics of the seminar or conference to which it belongs; these can then be customized for any particular talk.
    Changing the topics of a seminar or conference has no impact on existing talks, it is relevant only to new talks and to users searching seminars or conferences by topic.

weekday:
  title: Meeting day
  contents: |
    Set this attribute if your seminar meets on a particular day of the week (even if your seminar does not meet every week).
    If specified, this value will be used to layout the scheduling grid for adding talks to your seminar.
    <br><br>
    We are aware that many seminars meet on two or more particular days each week and plan to support this option in the near future.
    For the moment we suggest either setting the meeting day to the first day of the week your seminar meets and then editing the dates on the scheduling grid,
    or not setting the meeting day and setting the frequency to 1, which will give you a scheulding grid with slots for each day.
frequency:
  title: Frequency
  contents: |
    Specify the frequency of your seminar if it meets at regular intervals(every 7 or 14 days, for example).
    If your seminar does not meet on a particular day of the week you can set the frequency to 1 to get a scheduling grid with a slot for each day.
per_day:
  title: Talks per day
  contents: |
    The number of talks you expect to take place each day your seminar or conference meets.
    This is used only to determine the number of slots to create in your scheduling grid; you can always add more talks on a particular day if you wish.
start_date:
  title: Start date
  contents: |
    The date on which your conference begins.
end_date:
  title: End date
  contents: |
    The date on which your conference ends.
seminar_start_time:
  title: Start time
  contents: |

seminar_end_time:
  title: End time
  contents: |
    The time of day your seminar usually ends, specified in 24 hour format (so 4 or 4:00 is 4AM, use 16:00 for 4PM).
timezone:
  title: Timezone
  contents: |
    Each talk, seminar, and conference has a timezone that determines how dates and times associated to the event will be interpreted.
    Even if your event has no particular physical location, you must set this so that we know how to interperet dates and times that you enter.
    Note that a timezone is in general not the same as a UTC offset, since it takes adjustments for daylight savings time into account,
    but you can choose UTC as your timezone if you wish.
    <br><br>
    Dates and times shown to visitors of mathseminars.org are automatically translated into the taken of their user account or of their
    computer.  This includes organizers who are adding talks to seminars or conferences; when editing a schedule the timezone of the seminar
    or conference will be used, but when browsing talks your user timezone will be used.
room:
  title: Room
  contents: |
    The physical location of a talk, seminar, or conference; leave this blank for events that take place solely online.
    When a new talk is created the room is copied from the seminar or conference to which it belongs but may then be changed.
    Note that changing the room of a seminar or conference has no impact on talks that have already been created.
    You can use the comments to provide detailed instructions and a link to a map to help visitors find the room.
online:
  title: Online
  contents: |
    If your seminar can be attended online, indicate that here.  Seminars that provide a live feed of a meeting in a physical location should
    put the location as the Room and set the online option to yes.
live_link:
  title: Livestream link
  contents: |
    Events taking place online should list the URL of the livestream here.
    For seminars and conferences, if the livestream link is not the same for each talk you can put "see comments" here and then
    explain in the comments section how to get the livestream link for each talk.
    When a new talk is created the livestream link is copied from the seminar or conference to which it belongs and may then be changed.
    <br><br>
    If your livestream requires a password you should indicate in the comments how participants can obtain the password.
access:
  title: Access
  contents: |
    For talks, seminars, and conferences with a livestream link this determines whether the link will be shown to
    everyone who visits mathseminars.org, only to users  who have created an account on mathseminars.org, or only to endorsed users of mathseminars.org.
    When a new talk is created the access setting is copied from the seminar or conference to which it belongs and may then be changed.    
    If the livestream link is not set this value is ignored.
