Now
===

1. Subscriptions working

Admin (Edgar)
=====
1. Add ability to deal with spam: admins should be able to easily hide a page, which should shut down the editing ability of the user who changed it last

1. Stop connecting to the lmfdb database

1. add captcha to reset password and register

1. Use gmail's api or some other api

1. Forward back to page once you log in: https://github.com/LMFDB/lmfdb/blob/master/lmfdb/users/main.py#L251


Content creation
================

1. **Allow multiple categories (use multi select from [select-pure](https://www.npmjs.com/package/select-pure))**

1. Makes sure that content creators can delete talks and seminars if they want (medium)

1. Think about the model described at https://talks.cam.ac.uk/document/Adding+a+talk (notably, the ability to include others' subscription lists into your own)

1. Think about security model of how we update the display attribute when someone gets endorsed.  Does every talk/seminar that they're an organizer for get set to display=True?  Can this be taken advantage of by adding another user as an organizer who then gets endorsed, or transferring ownership?  We don't require permission to become an organizer/transfer.  Solved if we have newly endorsed users manually have to add the content they want to be displayed.  Also: if you aren't yet endorsed, you can't add other organizers or transfer ownership.

1. Interface for creating a singleton talk?

Viewing and searching
=====================

1. **Sort seminar and talks search results**

1. **Add type (conference/seminar) to seminar search.**

1. **One liner for seminars, add time and frequency.**

1. **Redesign top menu: enhance (bold) rather than pop out. **

1. **Save values in search results, add ability to clear inputs.**

1. **Make future the default search.**

1. **Paginate search results.**

1. **When searching, should have ability to flip sort order (default depends on whether past or future)**

1. **Add search on time (rather than datetime) so that users can accomodate their local schedules**

1. Figure out how to limit number of seminars shown on browse page for initial users (limit at a certain number per category?)

1. Should conference homepage be different than a seminar's?

1. Add route that strips headers for inclusion into a seminar webpage

1. When logged in, there should be an option to see the site as if you weren't logged in

1. On the homepage, there should be a note at top explaining benefit of logging in

1. In seminar lists, have icon for online vs offline talk (could be both)

1. We now have a warning that javascript is required (displayed at top of every page).  Another model:  https://iacr.org/tinfoil.html

Knowls
======

1. **Update knowl code and knowl database from LMFDB to give the ability to provide explanations (e.g. advertise that they can use latex, explain how to type a dollar sign, have placeholders with examples)**

Time zones
==========

Localization
============

1. Think about whether there is anything we should do to support other languages.  Maybe add a language column for talks and seminars?

Onboarding
==========

1. Write the About page

1. Add to the FAQ page

1. Create a message shown to a user when they first visit the site (detected by absence of the timezone cookie); make sure that information also included in About page

Feedback
========

1. Change **LMFDB error**

1. **Add avenues for users to give feedback both to admins and to content creators**

1. **We should create a privacy policy, discussion of cookies**

Calendars
=========

1. Write code for dynamically generating .ics files

Email
=====

1. Figure out how to make our emails less likely to be marked spam.

2. Customizable announcement emails for seminar organizers.

Design and branding
===================

1. **Clean up css file to remove all the old stuff, think about what we want to have.**

1. **Come up with a logo and favicon**

1. Think of a good name and register it

1. Once we're ready, think about advertising strategy (Bjorn emailing number theory list; how to reach out beyond number theory, posting on Facebook, etc)

Other
=====

1. scrape some timezones https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones

1. Write tests

1. Reach out to Kiran about recruiting organizers.

1. toggle option between http and https
